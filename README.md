# commit-standards

A Github App that verifies all commits in a PR follow the configured standards. Your answer to "my repo follows the community standard except..." or for easily enforcing your own standard.

## Configuration

Configuration isn't required but the standards enforced can be configured by the repo. Just add a `commit-standards.yml` file to the .`github` directory of the repo. 

```
# Each line of the file can contain a regex pattern that a commit must match.
# Lines in a commit message that don't have a corresponding regex pattern in
# the `commit-standards.yml` are not matched.
# A line that should only be a new line should be indicated with an empty string `''`
regexArray:
  - '^(?:docs|test)(?:\(.+\))?: [^A-Z ].+[^\.]$'
  - ''
  - 'description'
```

```
# You can add a link to where the commit standards configured here are documented
commitStandardsDocumentation: 'https://github.com/natashajokinen/commit-standards'
```

```
# Allow use of Merge commits (eg on github: "Merge branch 'main' into feature/cool-idea")
# By default this is true
allowMergeCommits: true
```

The default configured standards are the same as the [conventional commits definition](https://conventionalcommits.org/) with additional requirements that:
* the description is not capitalized
* the description does not end with a `.`
* the allowed types are listed below. Descriptions of each type are the same as [conventional commit types](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/v3.0.0/index.json) or self-explanatory
  * `feat`
  * `fix`
  * `docs`
  * `style`
  * `refactor`
  * `perf`
  * `test`
  * `chore`
  * `revert`
  * `demo`
  * `deprecate`

## Alternatives

If you'd like to follow the convetional commits definition as it is written [zeke/semantic-pull-requests](https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests) does just that.
